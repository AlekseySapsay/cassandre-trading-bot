A trading bot is a computer program that can automatically place orders to a market or exchange without the need for human intervention. Bots, automated trading strategies, are the future of investing, they are working for you 24/7 and never lose their focus.

Our goal with this project was to learn trading & data analysis by building an automated trading system for the cryptocurrencies markets. While learning, we built the bot and we decided to share our code, the problems encountered, lessons learned and technologies used.
