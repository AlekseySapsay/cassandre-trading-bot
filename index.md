A trading bot is a computer program that can automatically place orders to a market or exchange without the need for human intervention.

Cassandre is one of my recent side projects with [Blockchain2graph](https://github.com/straumat/blockchain2graph), [Cerise](https://github.com/straumat/cerise) and [Libraquery](https://github.com/straumat/libraquery). My goal was to learn trading & data analysis by building an automated trading system for the cryptocurrencies markets. By doing this, I want to share some of the problems encountered, lessons learned and technologies used.

Markets cannot be "predicted" because we can't predict some "big" events (A country banning Bitcoin, Bitcoin miner cashing out, A family office making an investment...). Sometimes you are on the right side of the market when such activity moves the price, and sometimes your are on the wrong side, you can't do anything about it.

The point we can take advantage of is that human traders and trading bots follow similar rules to make decisions. Guessing the rules they apply could allow you to guess and react to what is happening. This is what our bot should do !
