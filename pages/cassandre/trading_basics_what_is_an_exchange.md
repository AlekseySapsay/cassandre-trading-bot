Cryptocurrency exchanges like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) or [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/) are online platforms in which you can exchange one kind of asset for another based on the market value.

To make it simple, after creating an account, the exchange will allow you to buy an amount of a cryptocurrency in exchange of your euros/dollars. Be careful, in reality, you don't really "own" the cryptocurrency you will buy there : if you don't own the private key, you just have a "promise" that an exchange own you some assets.

Most exchanges also offers tools for trading cryptocurrency. For example, Coinbase offers [this tool](https://pro.coinbase.com/).

More interesting in our case, most exchanges offers API for trading like the [coinbase API](https://developers.coinbase.com/). Thanks to this, instead of spending hours trading in front of your computer, you can write a program that trades for your. That's the goal of our bot.
