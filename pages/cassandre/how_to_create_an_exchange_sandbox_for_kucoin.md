## Create a Kucoin account.
Go to [Kucoin sandbox](https://sandbox.kucoin.com/ucenter/signup) and create an account.

Move your assets (ETH, BTC...) from your main account to your trading account (Click on [Main Account](https://sandbox.kucoin.com/assets/main-account) link and then click on `transfer` in front of the corresponding cryptocurrency).

## Get API credentials.
Click on your profile on the top right of the screen and then `API management`, you will have to setup security before accessing the `create API` menu

Choose an API Name and API Passphrase. In the following configuration screen, set permissions to `Ì€General` and `Trade` and IP limit to `No Limit`.

This will give you the credentials required :
