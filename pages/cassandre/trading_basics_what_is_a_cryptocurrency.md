A cryptocurrency is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the transfer of assets. 

Cryptocurrencies use decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking systems.

Bitcoin is the first decentralized cryptocurrency. Since the release of bitcoin, over 6,000 other cryptocurrencies have been created.
