## Trading.

## Software development.

  * I bought a book named [Building Trading Bots Using Java](https://amzn.to/33PyJoW) to get an example of a trading bot architecture.
  * To create an efficient bot, I decided to build it as a Reactive application and to learn it, I bought [Hands-On Reactive Programming in Spring 5](https://amzn.to/36u6qP8) and [Hands-On Reactive Programming with Reactor:](https://amzn.to/2NeW0uT)
