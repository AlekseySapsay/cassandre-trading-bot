Trading simply means “exchanging one item for another”. In the financial markets, it's actually buying shares, futures, options, swaps, bonds etc... or like in our case, an amount of cryptocurrency. 

The idea here is to buy cryptocurrency at a certain price and sell it at a higher price to make profits (even if you can still make a profit if the price goes down).

To make it simple, the value of an asset changes due to supply and demand : if a lot of people want one bitcoin, the price will go up. If a lot of people want to sell one bitcoin, the price will go down.

Nowadays, thanks to exchanges like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) or [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/), anyone can start trading using the tools provided by those platforms. They even provide API allowing you to create bots (like the one we created : Cassandre) which automatically do the trading for you based on the rules you choose.
