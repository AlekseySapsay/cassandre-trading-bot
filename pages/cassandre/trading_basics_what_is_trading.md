Trading simply means “exchanging one item for another”. In the financial markets, it's actually buying shares of a company, or like in our case, an amount of cryptocurrency. 

The idea here is to buy cryptocurrency at a certain price and sell it at an higher price to make profits (even if you can still make profits if the price goes down).

To make it simple, the value of an asset changes due to supply and demand : if lots of peoples wants one bitcoin, the prices will go up. If lots of peoples wants to sell one bitcoin, the price will go down.

Nowadays, thanks to exchanges like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) or [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/), anyone can start trading using the tools provided by those platforms. They even provide API allowing to create bots (like the one we created Cassandre) that will automatically do the trading for you based on the rules you choose.

Investing and trading are two very different methods of attempting to profit in the financial markets. Investors seek larger returns over a long period. Traders, by contrast, take advantage of both rising and falling markets to enter and exit positions over a shorter timeframe.
