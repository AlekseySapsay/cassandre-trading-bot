An order is an instruction to the exchange to purchase or sell an asset for you. 

## Market Orders.
A market order is an order to buy or sell immediately at the current price. 

if you are going to buy an asset, you will pay a price at or near the ask price in the ticker. If you are going to sell an asset, you will receive an amount at or near the bid price in the ticker.

## Limit Orders.
A limit order, sometimes referred to as a pending order, allows you to buy and sell assets at a certain price in the future. 

This type of order is used to execute a trade if the price reaches the price you decided. The order will not be filled if price does not reach this level. 
In effect, a limit order sets the maximum or minimum price at which you are willing to buy or sell.

For example, you can make an order saying "I want to sell 1 bitcoin when it will reach 4,000$".
