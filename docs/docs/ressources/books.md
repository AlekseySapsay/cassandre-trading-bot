# Books

## Trading
* [Technical Analysis For Dummies](https://amzn.to/38TWaQm).

## Software development
* I bought [Building Trading Bots Using Java](https://amzn.to/33PyJoW) to understand how to build a trading bot from scratch.
* To create an efficient bot, I decided to build it as a Reactive application and to learn it, I bought [Hands-On Reactive Programming in Spring 5](https://amzn.to/36u6qP8) and [Hands-On Reactive Programming with Reactor](https://amzn.to/2NeW0uT).

## Open Source
* A good book to understand how an Open Source project works and how things are evolving: [Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software](https://amzn.to/3HSjgcU).
